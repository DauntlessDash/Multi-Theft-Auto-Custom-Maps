MULTI THEFT AUTO CUSTOM MAPS

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Multi Theft Auto (MTA) is a mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that is similar to garrys mod, giving modders like myself the opportunity to create custom multiplayer mods for San Andreas. Using MTA and Lua scripts it is possible to create custom maps and levels for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Since first working on mods in MTA I have created custom maps for different game modes, servers, and mods. A majority of my custom maps were created to be used as interiors for buildings in Valhalla Roleplay, United Gaming, Root Gaming, and Owlgaming. San Andreas defaultly included a fully detailed exterior city of Los Santos, but only about 20 of these buildings had interiors. In the mods I worked on properties could created from any exterior building in the game through the use of teleportation markers. That meant that we had to create new and unique interior worlds to match these buildings. When making a custom interior I prioritized creating spaces that would have a lot of different uses for the player rather than just being a decorative indoor area. 

In this respitory is a collection of some interiors that I have made including a courthouse, government offices, a Japanese restaurant, a butcher shop, a parking garage, photo studio, clothing store, chinese theatre, and many others. 

These maps are almost all located in interior world 0 in dimension 0.

If you want to use these maps on a server in MTA feel free, but please give me credit.
